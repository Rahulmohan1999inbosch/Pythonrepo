# while loop is preferred over for loop when you have a predefined condition
# But when you have to run the loop based on finite iteration we can go with for loop

while int(input('enter a number'))<34:
    print('hey')

else:
    print('you entered number greater than 34')

#using else with while loop

# do while is not used in python
